# Datasets used in this library

## Physiology data
- [Blood-Brain-Barrier Permeability](physiology/BBBP.csv) This data is taken from [moleculenet.org](https://moleculenet.org/datasets-1). The data contains SMILES strings for molecules as input features and labelling of whether or not the drug is passes blood-brain-barrier permeability.
- [SIDER](physiology/sider.csv) is database of marketed drugs and adverse drug reactions (ADR), grouped into 27 system organ classes. This data is taken from [moleculenet.org](https://moleculenet.org/datasets-1).
- [Tox21](physiology/tox21.csv): Qualitative toxicity measurements on 12 biological targets, including nuclear receptors and stress response pathways. This data is taken from [moleculenet.org](https://moleculenet.org/datasets-1).
- [ClinTox](physiology/clintox.csv)Qualitative data of drugs approved by the FDA and those that have failed clinical trials for toxicity reasons. This data is taken from [moleculenet.org](https://moleculenet.org/datasets-1).
- [ToxCast](physiology/toxcast.csv): Toxicology data for a large library of compounds based on in vitro high-throughput screening, including experiments on over 600 tasks. This data is taken from [moleculenet.org](https://moleculenet.org/datasets-1).
